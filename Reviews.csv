Potter,19,19,4,1163376000,Best of the Instant Oatmeals,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey."

It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.

It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal."

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."

I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it."

The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it."

The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat.

It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."

After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change.

But it gave my dog wicked gas..,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better."

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!"

I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A"").

I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore.

I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain.

I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet.

I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.

They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."

When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.

They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase!

Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"

From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would.

There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.

They look just like the picture on the box, they are so soft and chewy and the taste is delicious. They come in a vacume sealed package so I suggest once you open them you place the entire package minus the box in a gallon sized zip lock bag because they will go stale quickly. I experienced this when my hubby was ""sleep walking"" and opened up the box and placed the package back in the box and the next morning they were all hard and stale. We ended up eating them over the course of a couple days with milk/coffee and dunking them. Another way I store them is in a air tight container I picked up at the doller store and placed each cookie in a sandwich bag and placed them in the jar. That way when I'm packing the hubby's lunch I just grab a cookie in its sandwich bag and throw it into his lunch pale. I mention my husband alot because he constantly talks about these cookies to his friends, we had one of them come over the other day and he ran over to the jar and had him try one. His friend was HOOKED now he is also a loyal customer as is his wife. We don't really care for the raisin variety which is sad because I typically love raisin cookies.

Only 8g of sugar per cookie, and 5g of fat which is a tad higher than I would have liked but I would guess if they had cut more fat out they would have sacrificed a lot of the taste.

Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.  This week I put fingerling potatoes and sliced onions in the bottom of the pan, tossed them with a little garlic powder, olive oil, salt and pepper, then put chicken on top and seasoned like I mentioned above, letting some of the rotisserie seasoning fall on the potatoes....it was wonderful!"

I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso.

The espresso is foamy, smooth, has a wonderful body and just plain delicious. It prompted me to invest in a Gaggia espresso machine just so I can make it at home everyday, and it has become a morning ritual. I enthusiastically recommend this coffee (preferably the medium grind, not the dark grind) if you are a true coffee lover."

An ultrafine, delicate grind, almost like baby powder, with no waste.  Just pure concentrate of perfect coffee.  I do not work for Illy or Amazon, but simply love my morning cup.<br />Anyway, if you have struggled to find the perfect coffee, as I have, look no further.  In my opinion, this is the most consistantly delicious coffee I've ever had. It comes pressurized in nitrogen I believe, to assure it's freshness.  It is very potent, as the fine grind is intended for use in an espresso maker.  I however, use it in my drip coffee maker with spring water and a paper filter, at about two-thirds the usual strength of a standard drip grind.  Buy some for you, or as a gift for your favorite coffee addict friend. Enjoy!!"

My friend used it in a drip coffee maker and I couldn't believe how smooth it was, whether the scoop as level or heaping. Stronger maybe, but just as smooth. Moved on to Italy and would only hit coffee bars with the Illy insignia. Could only find it in the Italian North End in Boston, nowhere else. Finally, finally, it started showing up at Whole Foods and I started to buy it again. I've had Kona, I've had Jamaican Blue Mountain- they don't hold a candle to Illy. I use the expresso fine grind in my auto drip. I just use a paper filter and let it go a few minutes over the finished brew alarm because it's so finely ground, it's a slow drip. But it's worth it!

I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty.

They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.<br />These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.<br />My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy..."

I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.<br /><br />Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.<br />Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.<br /><br />But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words ""that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today."" I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.<br /><br />One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.<br /><br />As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.<br /><br />But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.<br /><br />I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best ""other country, Stateside Product"" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.<br /><br />So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!"

But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!<br /><br />A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:<br /><br />  ""...I can't believe how good they are!""<br /><br />.......................................................<br /><br />THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.<br /><br />Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.<br />1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!<br /><br />.....................................................<br /><br />FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.<br /><br />I recently made the mistake of trying to find a ""Belgian Chocolate Bargain"" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2"" x 2"" x 3"", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce ""REGULAR economy"" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:<br /><br />  "".....I can't believe how good they are!"""

Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.<br /><br />Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate."

The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them.

I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.<br /><br />I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.<br /><br />That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often."

Once added to the tarka (tempering)along with a few other spices, these leaves immediately give off a strong yet aromatic citrus like aroma. Although most commonly used in curries, leaves from the curry tree can be used in many other dishes to add flavor. In Cambodia, Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roasted it to a crunch and crushed it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. These leaves are NOT related to curry powder and you should purchase these fresh not dried for the best flavor for your dishes. Although it is nit advised to store these in the refrigerator, I have found that if wrapped properly in several paper towels then placed in a ziploc bag, they do last for a few days and up to a week.

Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.

Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out.

What is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor.

I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.

Livingston ""gluten free organic expert""",1,1,5,1263513600,"Schar Gluten Free Bread is GREAT for Pizza Dough, Calzones, Doughboys, Bread","Hi, 5 people in my family have had celiac for years, we are half Italian and very fussy about bread and pizza.  This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.  I bought and baked every bread mix on the market to determine which was best and Schar came out ahead of all closest to real bread than any others, Schar also has a great website with good tips on cooking gluten free and baking bread."

I have tried twice to make this bread in my machince following to the letter the directions on the box.  The bread turns out with a tough crust and a very rubber like texture.

After many unsuccessful attempts to recreate my favorite bread recipes using mixtures of various flour types, I decided to go the boxed route to see how things stacked up. Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says ""until doubled"". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't! Came out perfect, works for toast, french toast, sandwiches, etc... Love it! Buying my first five pack through Amazon now!"

The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.<br /><br />When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.<br /><br />I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.<br /><br />If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try."

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked."

Believe me, it would have to be for me to make it!<br /><br />It's pretty good following the package directions, but what really made it fantastic was adding a full additional cup of water to the recipe, as recommended by one of the other reviewers. (This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)<br /><br />Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.<br /><br />I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at ""warm"".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU"">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a><br /><br />After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:<br /><br />Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:<br /><br />1 Basic<br />1 1/2 pound loaf<br />Dark crust<br /><br />While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ."

After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.

Also, if you are familiar with these apple-chips, there are a lot of crumbs--about 1/3 crumbs.  If you are down to the last third of the bag, expect half of what you pop into your mouth to be sugar."

I wish I knew how to get in touch with the other person who reviewed them and didn't like them. I would be more than happy to take the 11 bags they're trying to get rid of! lol. : ) I guess they aren't as ""healthy"" as some people would like, if you're really watching what you eat. They do have quite a bit of sugar on them, but they taste so darn good. They're still better for you to eat rather than greasy potato chips. I highly recommend them! Very delicious! : )"
567338,B000LKTP9G,ABLXFZDC71O7E,Rachel,1,1,5,1340755200,"Crisp, tasty snack for an occasional treat!","These crispy apple chips are just that.  Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!"

They taste great, because they're cooked in oil and does have a little less fat than potato chips.<br /><br />Besides the ""non-healthiness"" of it, the box of 12 arrived at my door completely beaten up.  The package tape was unraveling and the box looked like it had just come back from a war zone--slightly smooshed and tearing at the seams.  There are no buffers or packaging materials in the box, with only the apple chip bags in there.  Thus, half of my chips were really just crumbs.<br /><br />I bought one bag in the store and there were quite a few crumbs in there too.  I wish the chips came more whole.

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."

They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Here is a poem they put on this box:<br /><br />""Ten thousand flowers in the spring, the moon in autumn, a cool breeze in summer, snow in winter.

So when I saw this 4-pack for Twisted Vine Gourmet, I decided to buy this. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Twisted Vine packages their products very well. Each bottle came individually wrapped, with enough packing material to ensure safe delivery.<br /><br />I used the Cabernet and Herb Grill Marinade with a pot roast, letting it simmer all day in the slow cooker until my family was ready to eat. Everybody loved it to the point where they had seconds. The Spicy Zinfandel Barbecue Sauce had more kick than we expected . . . a bit too much. Because of this, I plan on using half the bottle the next time I use this sauce for my chicken. I have yet to try it on burgers or steaks.<br /><br />The portabella had a good flavor. I used it for chicken and plan to use it again for a pot roast or burgers. The only marinade we haven't tried yet was the Chardonnay Chipotle. Given how spicy the Zinfandel was, I plan on using this sparingly.<br /><br />I recommend this marinade pack to anyone who enjoys rich, flavorful marinades. These are the best I've found so far."

Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.<br /><br />When I received my package of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.<br /><br />When my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!<br /><br />I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.<br /><br />If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait."

Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule ""grains"" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money."

It also had (& still has) their name on it as ""by Cultures of Health LLC"" but then further down is says ""Ships from and sold by Lifetime Kefir.""  I just want to clarify for everyone out there, who like me thought I was buying from a specific COMPANY that sells milk kefir, that this is not sold through Cultures for Health & it is not sponsored or affiliated with them in any way.  I contacted Cultures for Health today and the customer service lady said that they are not affiliated with this ""Lifetime Kefir"". I also received my kefir grains in a plastic baggie & wrapped in about 5 more plastic baggies, all smooshed up flat, and looking nothing like the cauliflower looking kefir grains you see pictures of.  Needless to say I was a little freaked out.  I decided to just try it out & see if the kefir grew and 'worked'.  -----  THAT BEING SAID ..... the kefir grew wonderfully! and has tripled or quadrupled in a months time.  I also sent the seller a question after working with and growing my kefir for about 2 or 3 days and he gave me a quick, polite, fairly thorough answer. Customer service seemed just good ... and quick.  I started with making about 1c of kefir and it was fizzy, clumpy/watery, weird.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be looking for but I guess this is normal and I just kept working with it each day changing the milk out and making new kefir.  It took about 1-2 weeks before it was producing well and I was making good kefir (not fizzy, but creamy now).  I was slowly figuring out how to work with the product.  I now make a quart jar of kefir daily.  I switch out the grains/kefir each morning and am left with about 3-4 cups of kefir each day.

There is nothing bad to say at all about the customer service with this seller, in my opinion.  He seems to go out of the way to make sure the buyer is fully satisfied with the product.  And the product seems great.  My grains have grown tremendously and I have probably 1 to 1 1/2 CUPS of kefir GRAINS now.  That is all from about 1T of smooshy, yellow looking 'stuff' (kefir grains) that I initially got from the seller.  It took a couple weeks for them to start working ""normally"" and looking more ""normal"" but just give them some time and they seem to come through and make great kefir.  The only reason for less than 5 stars is simply because I feel like there still is a little misleading advertising in the product.  It appears this seller (Lifetime Kefir) has a few different kefir grain ads/products on amazon & the one that I bought from ([...]) shows that it is ""by: Cultures for Health, LLC"" and ""shipped and sold by Lifetime Kefir"".  I thought I was buying the grains from Culture for Health through a middle-man, so to speak.  When actually it is not a Cultures for Health product at all.

When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to ""rehydrate"". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.<br /><br />Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains.

It was exactly the support I needed to have the confidence to start something that seemed so foreign!<br /><br />The first day I began to hydrate my grains, I mixed a cup of whole raw milk and the kefir grains in a canning jar with a coffee filter fixed to the top with a rubber band. The weather outside was very cold and subsequently it was pretty chilly on the inside of the house too, so I turned my oven light on and place the jar as far away from the light as possible and closed the door. I repeated this process the 2nd and 3rd day, but by the 4th day decided to leave it on the counter since the milk was separating to curds and whey by the end of the 24 hr period. I had kefir by day 5! It tasted clean and a little like buttermilk, yummy! I'm still learning, but feel confident that I'm off to a great start, thanks to Cultures for Health <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>!<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have this product! I save money by not having to buy powders, and my homemade kefir is better for my family than the pasteurized, sugar-filled, store-bought (expensive) version!"

I set it out on my counter every day with 1 cup of cow's milk and the next day I strain it with my plastic strainer, wash the glass jar, and then put the kefir back into the clean jar for the next day. I use the kefir to soak oats for breakfast the next day. I can then have this delicious oats and kefir either cold or hot. Thank you for the great product!"

I understand that, if you work with them over time they expand. I have worked with them twice -- the first time I followed instructions & made successive batches over a 4-day period. The second time I allowed 18 hours. The kefir grains have expanded, but not enough to make a good, thick batch of kefir....and the kefir tastes bitter. It is supposed to taste sour."

The milk kefir that they produce is not what I would consider real milk kefir. I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn ""Kefirlady"" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the ""slimy"" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that. Personally, I'd recommend getting them from a different vendor as these are woefully inadequate at accomplishing their intended purpose. Looks like I'll have to be getting some new grains..."

The milk kefir grains from CFH were great, and my child thoroughly enjoyed the milk kefir. I noticed a calming effect from it (likely the B Vitamins). They helped with our gut and regularity immensely.<br /><br />However, this is NOT a Cultures for Health company product. It is from 'Lifetime kefir."" I've never written a review before, and I do buy items very frequently online. I'm usually easy going with how things turn out through the mail. It arrived VERY warm and wet and in a PLASTIC bag. The dried kefir is much more shelf-stable through the mail and arrives in better packaging that doesn't leach chemicals into the product. Shipping was much slower than expected. It ended up shipping separately from my other items and arrived several days after the others. This is questionable whether it is safe to use because of the heat (it's summer here!) and plastic, and I certainly cannot give this to my small immune-compromised child of which is why I ordered this in the first place. For the customer service, I cannot yet say how they handled this issue, but I'm hoping for a full refund, shipping cost in all. I will update on the customer service aspect. Order directly from CFH.

They all seem to have good flavors, good ingredients, and they don't have as high of calories as some of the others do.<br /><br />Cinnamon Coffee Cake really did taste like a cinnamon coffee cake.  It was pleasantly sweet, with that hint of spice from the cinnamon, and there was a little bit of sweet frosting stuff drizzled on top too.  It definitely had the crunch as well from the different grains the bar was made up of.  And I liked the crunch, it really made it feel like you were biting into something substantial.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this bar.  Not the best out of all the brands out there, but still reasonably decent.  The main sweetener is Brown Rice Syrup, but there is also crystalline fructose and evaporated can juice crystals.  The grains are the Kashi seven grain blend that they like to advertise and there's wheat bran and a few other things included as well.  There are some hard to pronounce ingredients, but these appear to be the vitamins.<br /><br />This bar has 160 calories in it.  Not as much as some but still not enough to justify eating these as a snack.  Use them for when you're exercising, or don't have enough time for a full breakfast.  There is 5 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein as well.  Although there are 13 grams of sugar, which seems a little high.  I do have to say that eating one of these bars does not make me as full as other bars do.  I started getting hungry around ten am after eating the bar at 8 am.  But it still did ok in that aspect, and maybe I was just hungrier than usual.<br /><br />A great flavored bar, I'd definitely buy it again.  I can just see it being a good one to take on a bike trip or some other kind of event.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar.

Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.

Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."

Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.

I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products."

While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste.

It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa.

If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa.

It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it."

The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.

To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.

Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.<br /><br />So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.<br /><br />I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.<br /><br />I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation."

It comes in a plastic tub with an inner sealed bag so it should stay fresh longer if it is not opened right away. The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot. We were quite happy with this product and would order again.

Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.

Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks.

But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and ""Oh my God"", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the ""ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ."

Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada!

I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it.

As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others."

All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do ""roast"" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!"

568249,B00374ZKQ0,A2ZIXZP46B737P,D. J. Bradley,19,20,5,1296172800,Great Alternative Sweetener,"My review covers the Stevia In The Raw product in packet form. I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there."
568250,B00374ZKQ0,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,Chandler,38,45,1,1320192000,You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.,"First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't."
568251,B00374ZKQ0,A1I1V7QUWSMYGA,Your Online Bookstore,13,15,5,1265760000,This is the only brand out there with minimal aftertaste,"I'm not 100% certain this is the same product sold at [...], but this is the only place I could find to review it, and I wanted to review it somewhere.  I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with ""normal"" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener."

NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!,"I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been. Yay - finally a stevia I like."

I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda."

I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.

Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.<br /><br />The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.<br /><br />If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time."

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.

Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.

I tried to train our dog with ""Ceaser dog treats"",  it just made our puppy hyper.  If you compare the ingredients, you will know why.  Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food."

Lower in calories and loved by all the doggies.  Sweet potatoes seem to be their favorite Wet Noses treat!
